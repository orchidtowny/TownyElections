# TownyElections

Election system for Towny designed around my idea for Residential.

Nations and Towns may enable elections in three modes:
- Leader decides to call one
- 25% of residents call for one (resets every election cycle, if set)
- Happens every x amount of Towny days

Once an election has at least one candidate, voting can begin.
Votes can be changed until the election ends. New candidates can enroll until the election ends.

Voters will be able to rank candidates or omit them completely.
If their first candidate drops out or loses, their vote goes to their next candidate and the votes are recalculated.

At least 25% of the population has to vote for the election results to go into effect.
